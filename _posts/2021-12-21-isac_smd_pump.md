# Compact design

When I assemble surface mount components in combination with solder paste, I find it quite frustrating to have resistors and caps stuck at the very tip of the tweezers. So I decided to build a suction pen that I could bring with me and could work off the grid.

Isac is an hambugerized stack of common components:

-5V mini vacuum pump
-500mAh LiPo battery
-TP4056 battery charger (with battery protection circuit)
-1803BK motor driver

The price to build one is around 10â‚¬. Print the housing and assemble the parts with minimum effort. The electolithic cap at the motor driver has to be placed horizontally so the motor can fit in the enclosure.
